# StreamDeckPlusConfig

None of the GUIs for stream deck on linux support the +'s dials nicely at this point. This repo is me working with the python library, https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck, to make a setup that suits my needs (i.e. has good audio control)

Most of the audio handling here assumes existence of pulseaudio on the device.
